1,Sophisticated Wording,"Sophisticated wording reports how advanced words are in an essay, on average. Students can express their ideas using a variety of words. Sophisticated wording (also known as ""lexical sophistication"") refers to the extent to which students' writing includes words that are more advanced or less commonly found in spoken and written language. Essays with lower sophisticated wording scores may indicate that students are using more familiar and accessible words to express their ideas, whereas higher sophisticated wording scores may indicate that students are using more advanced and less familiar words to express their ideas.",1,3,sophisticated_wording_independent_rc1,2,2,"The extent to which more advanced, or less commonly found words are used."
2,Development of Ideas,"Development of ideas reports the density and usage of content words in an essay. Students develop their arguments with claims and evidence by elaborating on their ideas and structuring them in paragraphs. Essays with higher development of ideas scores indicate that students have expressed ideas across paragraphs in support of building their arguments with reasons and evidence, whereas essays with lower scores may indicate that students need to further elaborate on their ideas. Additionally, essays with very low scores in development of ideas may indicate the essay is not long enough to respond to the writing prompt.",1,3,development_of_ideas_independent_rc2,2,2,The extent to which ideas in an essay are developed and elaborated throughout an essay.
3,Word Variety,"Students can express themselves by repeating the same words or by using a variety of words. Word variety (also referred to as “lexical diversity”) reflects the number of different words in an essay in relation to the total number of words. High scores may indicate the essay includes a variety of unique words, and low scores may indicate repeated words. Very low or high scores may indicate the essay is too short to respond to the prompt.",1,3,word_variety_independent_rc3,2,2,The extent to which the text contains a variety of different words.
4,Information Density,"Information density reports the extent to which function words are used to communicate dense and precise information. Students can express their ideas using both content words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and function words (e.g., prepositions, determiners, pronouns). Content words may express specific information or ideas, while function words are used to describe relationships between content words. For example, in the following sentence function words are in red: ""The better team has a stronger defense because they work together."" The sentence could be revised to include more specific and sophisticated function words: The better team has the stronger defense because they work together towards a common goal. Changing the function word from ""a"" to ""the"" provides more specificity, and adding the function word ""towards"" provides a more sophisticated function word. High scores in information density may suggest the essay is overly verbose and pedantic, and low scores in information density may suggest the essay require additional description to communicate ideas and information effectively.",1,3,information_density_independent_rc4,2,2,"The extent to which an essay contains sentences with dense and precise information, which emphasize complex noun phrases and sophisticated and specific function words."
5,Word Concreteness,"Students can express themselves using a variety of words, including words that are more tangible. Word concreteness refers to how tangible words are (e.g., “table” or “mountain”), meaning the words refer to concepts that can be directly experienced through one or more physical senses (e.g., sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell). Word concreteness reports how concrete or tangible the words in an essay are, on average. High scores in word concreteness may indicate the essay contains more tangible words, while low scores may indicate an essay contains more abstract words. Very low or high scores may indicate that the student did not write enough to address the prompt.",1,3,word_concreteness_independent_rc5,2,2,"The degree to which the text contains words that are tangible and refer to concepts that can be experienced by the senses, on average."
6,Conventional Language,"Students can express their ideas in writing using grammatical and syntax structures that are commonly found in published writing (e.g., newspapers, novels). Conventional Language reports the extent to which an essay includes words and phrases that are constructed using grammar and sentence structure conventions that are associated with those found in published texts. A lower score in Conventional Language may indicate the writing includes grammatical errors or does otherwise not follow common grammatical and sentence structures found in published texts, whereas a higher score may indicate the essay includes grammar and sentence constructions that more closely resemble those found in published texts. Conventional Language indicates the ratio of words and phrases that match grammar constructions found in published texts.",1,3,appropriate_word_choice_independent_rc6,2,2,The extent to which the text contains words and phrases using grammar constructions mirrored in published texts.
7,Sentence Cohesion,"Students can repeat similar words across sentences and sections of their essay to express their ideas more clearly and cohesively. Sentence cohesion (also known as “local cohesion”) reports the extent to which the text contains connections based on the use of overlapping or repeated words across sentences. Very low local cohesion might suggest that the essay jumps between topics without signaling connections across the topics. Higher local cohesion may indicate the sentences are linked by topics; however, if local cohesion is too high, it may indicate that an essay is highly redundant, including the presence of many repeated words.",1,3,sentence_cohesion_independent_rc7,2,2,The degree to which there is overlap between words across sentences.
8,Academic Focus,"Academic focus reports the extent to which students address a prompt using vocabulary typically found in published academic texts. High scores in academic focus may indicate the essay is on-topic, and also uses academic vocabulary and a variety of sentence structures to convey information and ideas. Low scores in academic writing may indicate the essay may be off-topic and does not include academic vocabulary and sentence structure variety.  Very low or high scores in academic writing may indicate that the student did not write enough to address the prompt.",1,3,academic_focus_independent_rc8,2,2,The extent to which the text addresses a prompt and uses academic wording.
9,Conversational Writing Style,"Conversational writing style reports the extent to which students express ideas and information mirroring patterns found in conversation. A higher score in conversational writing style indicates that the essay may include elaborated personal opinions and anecdotes that are expressed using complex sentence structures. Low scores may indicate the essay contains simple and concise sentences. Medium scores may indicate the essay includes a variety of sentence structures, including elaborative opinions and concise sentences to express ideas and information. Very low or high scores may indicate the essay is too short to respond to the prompt.",1,3,conversational_writing_style_independent_rc9,2,2,"The extent to which the text is written in an informal conversational style, emphasizing personal opinions, anecdotes, and complex sentences."
10,Language Variety,"Students can express themselves by repeating the same words or by using a variety of words, and by repeating the same sentence structures or by using a variety of sentence structures. Language variety reflects both (1) the number of different words in an essay in relation to the total number of words, and (2) the number of different sentence structures in an essay. High scores in language variety indicate the essay contains unique words and sentence structures, and low scores may indicate the essay contains repeated words and sentence structures.

Very low or high scores may indicate the essay is too short to respond to the writing prompt.",3,3,academic_writing_dependent_rc2,2,2,The extent to which sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentence structures are used.
12,Sentence Cohesion,"Sentence cohesion reports the overlap of words across sentences, on average. Students can make connections between their ideas by repeating similar words across sentences in their essay. Sentence cohesion (also known as “local cohesion”) reports the extent to which the text contains connections based on the use of overlapping or repeated words across sentences. Very low sentence cohesion scores may indicate that an essay moves between topics without signaling connections using word overlap, whereas higher sentence cohesion scores may indicate the sentences are linked by shared words. If local cohesion is too high, it may indicate that an essay is highly redundant, including the presence of many repeated words.",3,3,sentence_cohesion_dependent_rc3,2,2,The degree to which there is overlap between words across sentences.
13,Development of Ideas,"Development of ideas reports the density and usage of content words in an essay.

14,Varied Sentence Structure,"Varied sentence structure reports the extent to which essays include a range of different sentence structures. Students can express their ideas using different types of sentence structures. Lower varied sentence structure scores may indicate that students are consistently using the same sentence structure (e.g., simple sentences with a subject and verb or more complex sentences with multiple clauses), whereas higher varied sentence structure scores may indicate that the essay includes a range of different sentence types. Very low or high scores may indicate the essay is too short to respond to the writing prompt.",3,3,varied_sentence_structure_dependent_rc5,2,2,The degree to which an essay includes a diversity of different sentence structures.
